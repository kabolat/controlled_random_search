# MATLAB Implementation of Controlled Random Search

Controlled Random Search (CRS) is one of the earliest approaches for the global optimization algorithms and it is found by W. L. Price in [\[1\]]. It is an extension of a simple random search method, where it is excepted the optimum point is the best point among a number of randomly selected points within the search space. Price combined this methodology with Nelder and Meadâ€™s simplex method so that an iterative approach can be applied and exploitation can be achieved. Later, this method has been advanced in [\[2\]] as CRS2 for better exploitation. This repository consists of the MATLAB implementations of CRS1 ([crs1.m]) and CRS2 ([crs2.m]) as well as their 2-D demonstrations ([CRS1_2dim.m], [CRS2_2dim.m]) with a selection of benchmark target functions ([bukin.m], [holder.m], [happycat.m], [rosenbrock.m]).
